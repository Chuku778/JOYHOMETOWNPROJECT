Welcome
This ia a solution to a solo project gotten from Scrimba.
TITLE- Build a homepage for your home town.
Here,I added a picture of my hometown,and I listed top three actiities I would do when next I visit my home town. These activities are visiting some tourist centres.
Three tourist centers include:
a. Visit to Nike lake: this is a lake people visit for leisure picknicking,it is well known because of the  resort built in the lake environment.
b. Visit the national museum Enugu: A treasure groove of artifacts teaching us abOut cultures and values.
c. Go to Milliken hills: it is a natural roller coaster,it is particularly stunning and casting a glow on the city.

for this project i use HTML5  and CSS for it's styling.
